# Docker Compose 
   This is a file with .yml extension.
   In this we have 3 Parent objects (Services, networks, Volumes)
   
   1. Services - Here we will define name of image(locally/pulls from container registry)
              We have a sectio called environment variables.
              And a sectio for Depends on
              we can limit service by memory
              We can define port for service
              
  
   3. Network - where we define networks 
   4. Volumes - If any volumes required, we will configure in this section.
